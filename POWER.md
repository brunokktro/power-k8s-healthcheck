# Kubernetes Health Check Power

## Overview

This Power enables comprehensive health checks and best practices validation for Kubernetes clusters. It combines two MCP servers (Kubernetes + EKS) to programmatically inspect cluster state and produce actionable findings categorized by severity.

**Scope:** Runtime cluster validation, configuration hygiene, and container image build practices.

**Applicable to:** Any Kubernetes cluster (via `kubernetes` MCP), with enhanced checks for AWS EKS clusters (via `awslabs.eks-mcp-server`).

**Based on:**
- [Kubernetes Configuration Good Practices](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/11/25/configuration-good-practices/)
- [Kubernetes Setup Best Practices](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/best-practices/)
- [AWS Well-Architected Container Build Lens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/container-build-lens/container-build-lens.html)
- [Amazon EKS Best Practices Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/best-practices/introduction.html)

---

## Onboarding

When this Power is first used, validate the required tooling before running any checks.

### Step 1: Validate prerequisites

- **kubectl** (required for the `kubernetes` MCP server)
  - Verify with: `kubectl version --client`
  - A reachable cluster context must be configured: `kubectl config current-context`
- **Helm v3** (required for Helm-related checks)
  - Verify with: `helm version`
- **AWS CLI + credentials** (required only for EKS-specific checks)
  - Verify with: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
- **uv / uvx** (runtime for `awslabs.eks-mcp-server`)
  - Verify with: `uvx --version`

**CRITICAL:** If `kubectl` cannot reach a cluster, do NOT proceed. Ask the user to fix their kubeconfig context first. EKS-specific checks are skipped automatically when AWS credentials are not available.

### Step 2: Confirm read-only posture

This Power is designed for **read-only assessment**. The bundled MCP servers run without write/mutation flags by default:
- `awslabs.eks-mcp-server` runs in read-only mode (no `--allow-write`).
- `mcp-server-kubernetes` can be hardened further with `ALLOW_ONLY_NON_DESTRUCTIVE_TOOLS=true` (see README).

---

## Available MCP Servers

### Server: `kubernetes`
General-purpose Kubernetes cluster operations via kubectl/Helm.

**Key tools for health checks:**
| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `kubectl_get` | List resources across namespaces (pods without limits, services without selectors, etc.) |
| `kubectl_describe` | Deep inspect specific resources for misconfigurations |
| `kubectl_logs` | Check for crash loops, error patterns |
| `list_api_resources` | Discover deprecated API usage |
| `explain_resource` | Validate resource field usage |
| `kubectl_generic` | Run `kubectl top`, custom queries |
| `exec_in_pod` | Validate runtime configuration inside containers |

### Server: `awslabs.eks-mcp-server`
AWS EKS-specific operations and insights.

**Key tools for health checks:**
| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `get_eks_insights` | Native EKS cluster insights (misconfigurations + upgrade readiness) |
| `list_k8s_resources` | List resources with EKS-aware context |
| `get_cloudwatch_metrics` | CPU/memory utilization for right-sizing |
| `get_cloudwatch_logs` | Control plane logs for error patterns |
| `get_eks_vpc_config` | VPC/subnet/route table validation |
| `get_pod_logs` | Pod-level log analysis |
| `get_k8s_events` | Event-based issue detection |
| `get_policies_for_role` | IAM role permission audit |

## Health Check Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Cluster Type

Ask the user:
- Is this an EKS cluster? (enables AWS-specific checks)
- Cluster name and region (if EKS)
- Which pillars to check? (all by default)

### Step 2: Execute Checks by Pillar

For each active pillar, load the corresponding steering file and execute the checks programmatically using MCP tools. Each check produces a finding.

### Step 3: Generate Report

Produce a structured report with:

```text
## Summary
- Total checks: N
- CRITICAL: X | HIGH: Y | MEDIUM: Z | LOW: W | PASS: P

## Findings by Pillar

### [Pillar Name]

| # | Severity | Check | Finding | Recommendation |
|---|----------|-------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | CRITICAL | ... | ... | ... |
```

### Step 4: Prioritized Actions

End with a prioritized action list:
1. CRITICAL items (fix immediately)
2. HIGH items (fix this sprint)
3. MEDIUM items (plan for next cycle)
4. LOW items (nice-to-have improvements)

---

## Severity Definitions

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **CRITICAL** | Active security vulnerability, data loss risk, or production outage risk | Fix immediately |
| **HIGH** | Significant best practice violation with tangible negative impact | Fix within current sprint |
| **MEDIUM** | Best practice deviation with moderate risk | Plan remediation |
| **LOW** | Minor improvement opportunity | Address when convenient |
| **PASS** | Check passed, no issue found | No action needed |
| **INFO** | Informational observation, no action required | Awareness only |

---

## Quick Start Examples

### Full Health Check (EKS)
```text
"Run a full health check on my EKS cluster 'production' in us-east-1"
```

### Security-Only Check
```text
"Check security best practices on my current Kubernetes context"
```

### Upgrade Readiness
```text
"Is my EKS cluster 'staging' ready to upgrade from 1.29 to 1.30?"
```

### Cost Optimization Scan
```text
"Find idle resources and right-sizing opportunities in namespace 'production'"
```

### Configuration Hygiene
```text
"Validate YAML and labeling best practices across all namespaces"
```

---

## Best Practices for Using This Power

- Run full health checks monthly or before major changes
- Run upgrade readiness checks before every EKS version upgrade
- Run security checks after any RBAC or network policy change
- Run cost checks quarterly for optimization planning
- Use namespace filters to scope checks to specific workloads
- Compare findings over time to track improvement

---

## Tools Reference (Cross-Pillar)

These kubectl patterns are used across multiple checks:

```bash
# Pods without resource requests
kubectl_get: pods, allNamespaces=true, output="json"
# Filter: .spec.containers[].resources.requests == null

# Pods without probes
kubectl_get: pods, allNamespaces=true, output="json"
# Filter: .spec.containers[].livenessProbe == null OR readinessProbe == null

# Naked pods (not managed by a controller)
kubectl_get: pods, allNamespaces=true, output="json"
# Filter: .metadata.ownerReferences == null

# Services without selectors
kubectl_get: services, allNamespaces=true, output="json"
# Filter: .spec.selector == null

# PodDisruptionBudgets coverage
kubectl_get: poddisruptionbudgets, allNamespaces=true

# NetworkPolicies per namespace
kubectl_get: networkpolicies, allNamespaces=true

# Deprecated API detection
list_api_resources (cross-reference with workload apiVersion fields)
```

---

## Limitations

- Image build checks are documentation-based guidance (cannot scan images at runtime without additional tooling)
- Cost checks require CloudWatch Container Insights enabled for metric-based analysis
- Some scalability thresholds are approximate and depend on instance types and workload patterns
- Network policy checks verify existence, not correctness of rules
- PKI certificate expiry checks require exec access to nodes or control plane logs
